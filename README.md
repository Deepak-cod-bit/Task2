# Task2
I created a simple to-do list app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I set up the basic layout with an input box, an "Add" button, and a task list (ul).  I styled everything with CSS to keep it clean and easy to read.  I added JavaScript to listen for clicks on the Add button.  When a task is added, it shows up instantly in the list without reloading the page.  I made sure each task can be marked as complete by clicking on it (using a toggle class).  I also added a remove button next to each task so it can be deleted easily.  I tested everythingâ€”adding, completing, and deleting tasks all work smoothly.   This was a fun task to practice DOM manipulation and event handling!
